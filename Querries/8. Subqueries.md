# Subqueries

Subqueries, also known as nested queries or inner queries, are SQL queries embedded within another SQL statement, such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE. They allow you to retrieve data from multiple tables by performing queries within queries. Subqueries can be used in various parts of a SQL statement, such as the WHERE clause, FROM clause, SELECT clause, or even within other subqueries.

Here are examples of how to write subqueries in different contexts:

**Subquery in WHERE Clause:**

- Suppose we have two tables: employees and departments. We want to retrieve the names of departments that have more than five employees.

```sql
SELECT department_name
FROM departments
WHERE department_id IN (
    SELECT department_id
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY department_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 5
);
```

In this example, the inner query selects the department_id from the employees table and groups them by department. The outer query then retrieves the department_name from the departments table where the department_id matches those returned by the inner query.

**Subquery in SELECT Clause:**

Suppose we want to retrieve the total number of employees in each department along with their respective department names.

```sql
SELECT department_name,
       (SELECT COUNT(*)
        FROM employees
        WHERE
            employees.department_id = departments.department_id) AS total_employees
FROM departments;
```

Here, the subquery in the SELECT clause calculates the count of employees for each department, and the outer query retrieves the department name from the departments table. This produces a list of department names along with the total number of employees in each department.

**Subquery in FROM Clause:**

Suppose we want to retrieve the average salary of employees in each department.

```sql
SELECT
    department_name,
    avg_salary
FROM departments
JOIN (
    SELECT
        department_id,
        AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY department_id
) AS dept_salary
ON departments.department_id = dept_salary.department_id;
```

Here, the subquery in the FROM clause calculates the average salary for each department and creates a temporary table. The outer query then joins this temporary table with the departments table based on the department_id, retrieving the department name along with the average salary.

These examples illustrate how subqueries can be used to retrieve data from multiple tables or to perform complex calculations within SQL queries. Subqueries provide flexibility and are powerful tools for data retrieval and analysis in SQL.
