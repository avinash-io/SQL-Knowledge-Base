# Views, Stored Procedures, and Functions

Let's delve into each of these database objects: views, stored procedures, and user-defined functions, along with examples for each.

### Views:

Views in SQL are virtual tables derived from the result of a SELECT query. They allow you to encapsulate complex SQL queries and provide a simplified interface to users. Views can join tables, filter rows, and perform calculations, just like regular SQL queries.

Example:

Suppose you have two tables: employees and departments. You want to create a view that combines information from these tables to show employee details along with their department names.

```sql
-- Create a view to display employee details along with department names
CREATE VIEW EmployeeDetails AS
SELECT
    e.employee_id,
    e.employee_name,
    e.salary,
    d.department_name
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d
ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

Now, you can query this view like a table:

```sql
-- Query the view to retrieve employee details
SELECT * FROM EmployeeDetails;
```

### Stored Procedures:

Stored procedures are a set of SQL statements that are stored in the database and can be executed as a single unit. They can accept parameters, perform operations, and return results. Stored procedures help encapsulate business logic and provide a reusable and maintainable way to interact with the database.

Example:

Let's create a stored procedure that retrieves employee details based on the department ID.

```sql
-- Create a stored procedure to retrieve employee details by department ID
CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeesByDepartmentID (@deptID INT)
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id = @deptID;
END;
```

You can execute this stored procedure by passing the department ID as a parameter:

```sql
-- Execute the stored procedure to retrieve employees in a specific department
EXEC GetEmployeesByDepartmentID 101;
```

### User-Defined Functions (UDFs):

User-defined functions are custom functions created by users to encapsulate frequently used logic. They can accept parameters and return a single value or a table. UDFs can be used in SELECT, WHERE, and JOIN clauses to perform calculations or transformations on data.

Example:

Let's create a simple user-defined function to calculate the total salary for employees in a specific department.

```sql
-- Create a scalar-valued function to calculate total salary by department ID
CREATE FUNCTION CalculateTotalSalary (@deptID INT)
RETURNS INT
AS
BEGIN
DECLARE @totalSalary INT;
SELECT @totalSalary = SUM(salary) FROM employees WHERE department_id = @deptID;
RETURN @totalSalary;
END;
```

You can use this function in a SELECT statement to calculate the total salary:

```sql
-- Use the function to calculate total salary for a department
SELECT department_id, CalculateTotalSalary(department_id) AS total_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id;
```

These examples illustrate how views, stored procedures, and user-defined functions can be created and utilized in SQL to encapsulate logic and enhance maintainability in database operations.
