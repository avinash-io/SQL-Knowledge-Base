# Aggregate Functions

Aggregate functions are used in SQL to perform calculations on sets of values and return a single result. Here's a breakdown of each aggregate function with examples:

**COUNT():**

The COUNT() function is used to count the number of rows in a result set.

Example:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_customers
FROM customers;
```

This query counts the total number of customers in the "customers" table.

**SUM():**

The SUM() function calculates the sum of values in a column.
Example:

```sql
SELECT SUM(order_total) AS total_sales
FROM orders;
```

This query calculates the total sales by summing up the values in the "order_total" column of the "orders" table.

**AVG():**

The AVG() function calculates the average of values in a column.

Example:

```sql
SELECT AVG(product_price) AS average_price
FROM products;
```

This query calculates the average price of products by averaging the values in the "product_price" column of the "products" table.

**MIN():**

The MIN() function retrieves the minimum value from a column.

Example:

```sql
SELECT MIN(order_date) AS earliest_order_date
FROM orders;
```

This query finds the earliest order date by retrieving the minimum value from the "order_date" column of the "orders" table.

**MAX():**

The MAX() function retrieves the maximum value from a column.

Example:

```sql
SELECT MAX(order_date) AS latest_order_date
FROM orders;
```

This query finds the latest order date by retrieving the maximum value from the "order_date" column of the "orders" table.

These examples demonstrate how to use aggregate functions in SQL queries to perform calculations on data sets. Aggregate functions are commonly used in conjunction with the SELECT statement and GROUP BY clause to generate meaningful summaries of data.
