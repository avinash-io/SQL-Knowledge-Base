# Data Manipulation Language (DML)

Let's start with Data Manipulation Language (DML), which includes SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements. I'll explain each of them with examples.

**1. SELECT Statement:**

The SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from a database table.

Example:

Let's say we have a table called employees with columns id, name, age, and salary. To retrieve all data from the employees table, you would use:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

This query will return all rows and columns from the employees table.

If you want to retrieve specific columns, you can specify them in the SELECT statement:

```sql
SELECT name, age FROM employees;
```

This query will only return the name and age columns from the employees table.

**2. INSERT Statement:**
The INSERT statement is used to add new rows of data into a database table.

Example:

Let's say we want to insert a new employee into the employees table. We can do it like this:

```sql
INSERT INTO employees (name, age, salary) VALUES ('John Doe', 30, 50000);
```

This query will insert a new row into the employees table with the specified name, age, and salary values.

**3. UPDATE Statement:**
The UPDATE statement is used to modify existing data in a database table.

Example:

Let's say we want to update the salary of an employee named 'John Doe' to 55000. We can do it like this:

```sql
UPDATE employees SET salary = 55000 WHERE name = 'John Doe';
```

This query will update the salary column of the employee whose name is 'John Doe' to 55000.

**4. DELETE Statement:**

The DELETE statement is used to remove rows from a database table.

Example:

Let's say we want to delete an employee from the employees table whose id is 101. We can do it like this:

```sql
DELETE FROM employees WHERE id = 101;
```

This query will delete the row from the employees table where the id is 101.

These are the basic examples of using DML statements in SQL. Remember to be cautious when using INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements, as they can modify data irreversibly. It's always a good practice to backup your data before performing such operations, especially in a production environment.
