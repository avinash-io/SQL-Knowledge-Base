# Data Definition Language (DDL)

Let's dive into Data Definition Language (DDL) commands with examples for creating, altering, and dropping various database objects like tables, views, and indexes.

**1. Creating Tables:**

Creating tables is one of the fundamental tasks in database management. Here's an example of creating a simple table for storing employee information:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
FirstName VARCHAR(50),
LastName VARCHAR(50),
DepartmentID INT,
JoiningDate DATE
);
```

In this example:

- We use the CREATE TABLE statement followed by the table name Employees.
- Inside the parentheses, we define columns along with their data types (INT, VARCHAR, DATE, etc.).
- PRIMARY KEY constraint is used to uniquely identify each record in the table.

**2. Altering Tables:**

Sometimes, you need to modify existing tables. Here's how you can add a new column to the Employees table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE Employees
ADD Email VARCHAR(100);
```

This command adds a new column Email of data type VARCHAR(100) to the Employees table.

**3. Dropping Tables:**

To remove a table from the database, you use the DROP TABLE command. Here's an example:

```sql
DROP TABLE Employees;
```

This command will delete the Employees table and all of its data.

**4. Creating Views:**

Views are virtual tables generated from the result of a SELECT query. Here's an example of creating a view to display employee names and their departments:

```sql
CREATE VIEW EmployeeDetails AS
SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName, d.DepartmentName
FROM Employees e
JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID;
In this example, EmployeeDetails is the name of the view. It selects FirstName and LastName from the Employees table and DepartmentName from the Departments table.
```

**5. Dropping Views:**

To drop a view, you use the DROP VIEW command. For example:

```sql
DROP VIEW EmployeeDetails;
```

This command will delete the EmployeeDetails view.

**6. Creating Indexes:**

Indexes are used to speed up data retrieval operations. Here's an example of creating an index on the EmployeeID column of the Employees table:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_EmployeeID ON Employees(EmployeeID);
```

This creates an index named idx_EmployeeID on the EmployeeID column of the Employees table.

**7. Dropping Indexes:**

To remove an index, you use the DROP INDEX command. For example:

```sql
DROP INDEX idx_EmployeeID ON Employees;
```

This command will delete the idx_EmployeeID index from the Employees table.

These examples cover the basic operations of Data Definition Language (DDL) commands for creating, altering, and dropping database objects such as tables, views, and indexes. Practice these commands to become familiar with managing database structures effectively.
