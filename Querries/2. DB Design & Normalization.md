# Database Design Principles:

Database design is the process of organizing and structuring data to facilitate efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation. It involves defining tables, relationships between tables, and constraints to ensure data integrity. The two main principles of database design are normalization and denormalization.

## Normalization:

Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database efficiently. It reduces data redundancy and minimizes the likelihood of data anomalies (such as insertion, update, and deletion anomalies). The normalization process involves breaking down large tables into smaller, related tables and defining relationships between them.

There are different normal forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF, 4NF, 5NF) that define progressively stricter rules for database normalization. Typically, aiming for at least third normal form (3NF) is sufficient for most databases.

**1. First Normal Form (1NF):**

In 1NF, each column in a table must contain atomic (indivisible) values, meaning that each value in the column must be indivisible and cannot be further broken down into smaller components.

There should be no repeating groups or arrays of data within a row.

Example:

Table: Orders

| StudentID | Name  | Subjects         |
| --------- | ----- | ---------------- |
| 1         | John  | Math, Science    |
| 2         | Alice | English, History |

This violates 1NF because the Subjects column contains multiple values separated by commas. It should be split into a separate table.

**2. Second Normal Form (2NF):**

To achieve 2NF, a table must be in 1NF, and each non-key column must be fully dependent on the entire primary key, not just part of it.

This means that if a table has a composite primary key, each non-key column must depend on both parts of the key, not just one part.

Example:

Table: Orders

| OrderID | ProductID | Price |
| ------- | --------- | ----- |
| 1       | 101       | $10   |
| 1       | 102       | $15   |
| 2       | 101       | $10   |

In this table, both OrderID and ProductID together form the primary key. Price is dependent only on ProductID, not on the entire primary key. To achieve 2NF, Price should be moved to a separate table.

**3. Third Normal Form (3NF):**

In 3NF, a table must be in 2NF, and no transitive dependencies should exist. A transitive dependency occurs when a non-key column depends on another non-key column, which is dependent on the primary key.

To eliminate transitive dependencies, non-key columns that depend on other non-key columns should be moved to their own tables.

Example:

Table: Employees

| EmployeeID | Department | Manager |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------- |
| 101        | IT         | John    |
| 102        | HR         | Alice   |

In this table, Manager is dependent on Department, which is not the primary key. To achieve 3NF, Manager should be moved to a separate table.

**4. Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF):**

BCNF is a stricter form of 3NF. It applies when there are multiple candidate keys in a table.

In BCNF, every determinant (a column that determines the value of another column) must be a candidate key.

Example:

Table: Students
| StudentID | Subject | Professor |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| 1 | Math | Smith |
| 2 | English | Johnson |
| 2 | History | Johnson |

In this table, {StudentID, Subject} and {Subject} are candidate keys. Professor is dependent only on Subject, which is not a candidate key. To achieve BCNF, Professor should be moved to a separate table.

**5. Fourth Normal Form (4NF) and Fifth Normal Form (5NF):**

4NF and 5NF are even stricter forms of normalization that deal with multi-valued dependencies and join dependencies, respectively.

They are less commonly encountered in practice compared to 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF, but may be applicable in certain specialized scenarios.

Understanding and applying these normal forms help in designing well-structured databases that reduce redundancy and ensure data integrity.

## Denormalization:

Denormalization is the process of intentionally adding redundancy to a database for performance reasons. It involves combining tables and duplicating data to reduce the number of joins required for queries. While denormalization can improve query performance, it may also lead to data inconsistency if not carefully managed.

### Types of Keys:

**1. Primary Key (PK):** A primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a table. It ensures that each row in the table is uniquely identifiable. Primary keys can be composed of one or multiple columns. By default, primary keys are indexed.

Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Students (
StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
Name VARCHAR(50),
Age INT
);
```

**2. Foreign Key (FK):** A foreign key is a field or combination of fields that establish a link between data in two tables. It enforces referential integrity by ensuring that values in the foreign key column(s) match values in the primary key column(s) of the referenced table.

Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Orders (
OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
ProductID INT,
CustomerID INT,
FOREIGN KEY (ProductID) REFERENCES Products(ProductID),
FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID)
);
```

**3. Composite Key:** A composite key is a primary key composed of multiple columns. Together, these columns uniquely identify each record in the table.

Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Orders (
OrderID INT,
ProductID INT,
CustomerID INT,
PRIMARY KEY (OrderID, ProductID)
);
```

**4. Natural Key:** A natural key is a column or set of columns that already exist in the data and can uniquely identify each record without the need for additional artificial identifiers.

Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
SSN VARCHAR(9) UNIQUE,
Name VARCHAR(50),
...
);
```

These examples demonstrate the creation of tables with primary keys, foreign keys, and composite keys. Understanding and applying these concepts will help you design efficient and maintainable databases.
