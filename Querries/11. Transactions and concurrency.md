# Transactions and concurrency

Transactions and concurrency control are essential concepts in database management systems (DBMS) to ensure data integrity and consistency, especially in multi-user environments where multiple transactions may be accessing and modifying the same data concurrently. These concepts are often summarized by the ACID properties: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.

## Atomicity:

Atomicity ensures that a transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit of work. It either completes in its entirety or is entirely rolled back if an error occurs.
This property is maintained through the use of transaction control statements like COMMIT and ROLLBACK.

## Consistency:

Consistency ensures that the database remains in a consistent state before and after the transaction. The database must follow all defined rules and constraints.
Consistency is typically enforced through the use of integrity constraints, such as primary key constraints, foreign key constraints, and check constraints.

## Isolation:

Isolation ensures that the execution of transactions concurrently does not result in interference between transactions. Each transaction should operate independently of others.

Isolation levels define the degree to which the transactions are isolated from each other. Common isolation levels include Read Uncommitted, Read Committed, Repeatable Read, and Serializable.

## Durability:

Durability guarantees that once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent and will not be lost, even in the event of a system failure.

Durability is typically achieved through mechanisms like transaction logging and database backups.

Now, let's illustrate these concepts with examples using SQL syntax:

**Example 1:** Atomicity and Transaction Control

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION; -- Start a new transaction

UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance - 100 WHERE AccountNumber = '123'; -- Deduct $100 from account balance

INSERT INTO Transactions (AccountNumber, Amount, Type) VALUES ('123', -100, 'Withdrawal'); -- Record the transaction

COMMIT; -- Commit the transaction
```

If any error occurs during the transaction, it can be rolled back to maintain atomicity

```SQL
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance + 100 WHERE AccountNumber = '456';

INSERT INTO Transactions (AccountNumber, Amount, Type) VALUES ('456', 100, 'Deposit');

-- An error occurs here (e.g., network issue)
ROLLBACK; -- Roll back the transaction to maintain atomicity
```

**Example 2:** Consistency with Integrity Constraints

```SQL
CREATE TABLE Employees (
EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
FirstName VARCHAR(50),
LastName VARCHAR(50),
DepartmentID INT,
CONSTRAINT FK_Department FOREIGN KEY (DepartmentID) REFERENCES Departments(DepartmentID)
);
```

The above table ensures that every employee belongs to an existing department, maintaining consistency.

**Example 3:** Isolation with Transactions

Assume we have two concurrent transactions updating the same account balance

#### Transaction 1

```SQL
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance - 50 WHERE AccountNumber = '789';
```

#### Transaction 2

```SQL
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance + 100 WHERE AccountNumber = '789';
```

Depending on the isolation level, the transactions might behave differently regarding visibility of changes made by the other transaction.

---

Let's expand on the isolation example with two concurrent transactions updating the same account balance and explore how different isolation levels can affect the outcome. We'll use a simple table called Accounts with just one account for demonstration purposes.

Assume the following initial state:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Accounts (
    AccountNumber INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Balance DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

INSERT INTO Accounts (AccountNumber, Balance) VALUES (789, 1000);
```

Now again, let's consider two concurrent transactions:

#### Transaction 1:

```sql
Copy code
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance - 50 WHERE AccountNumber = 789;
```

#### Transaction 2:

```sql
Copy code
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance + 100 WHERE AccountNumber = 789;
```

Now, let's explore how different isolation levels can affect the outcome:

**Read Uncommitted (the lowest isolation level):**

- Transaction 2 reads uncommitted changes from Transaction 1. It may see intermediate, uncommitted states of the data.
- This can lead to dirty reads, meaning Transaction 2 might see changes made by Transaction 1 that are later rolled back.

**Read Committed:**

- Transaction 2 only sees changes committed by Transaction 1. It will not see uncommitted changes.
- However, this still allows non-repeatable reads because Transaction 1 might commit its changes before Transaction 2 completes, resulting in Transaction 2 seeing different data in subsequent reads.

**Repeatable Read:**

- Transaction 2 sees a consistent snapshot of the data at the time it began.
- It prevents non-repeatable reads, meaning Transaction 2 will see the same data in subsequent reads even if Transaction 1 commits changes.

**Serializable (the highest isolation level):**

-Transaction 2 executes as if it's the only transaction running. It does not see changes made by Transaction 1 until Transaction 1 commits.
-This ensures the highest level of data integrity but can lead to concurrency issues and performance degradation, as it might result in more locks and lower concurrency.

Let's examine these scenarios and their potential outputs:

```sql
-- Scenario with Read Uncommitted

-- Transaction 1 (Read Uncommitted)

BEGIN TRANSACTION;

UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance - 50 WHERE AccountNumber = 789;

-- Transaction 2 (Read Uncommitted)
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance + 100 WHERE AccountNumber = 789;

-- Suppose Transaction 1 is rolled back before Transaction 2 commits.
-- In this case, Transaction 2 may see an intermediate, uncommitted state of the data from Transaction 1.
-- The result could be:
-- Transaction 2 completes successfully, and the balance becomes 1050 temporarily.
-- However, if Transaction 1 is rolled back later, the balance should revert to its original state (1100).

-- Output (temporary):
-- AccountNumber | Balance
-- 789 | 1050.00

-- If Transaction 1 is rolled back:
-- Output (final):
-- AccountNumber | Balance
-- 789 | 1100.00
```

**Example 4:** Durability with Transaction Logging

Most DBMS systems automatically maintain transaction logs for durability

After a COMMIT statement, the changes are logged and written to disk, ensuring durability even in the event of a system failure.

These examples demonstrate how transactions and concurrency control mechanisms, along with the ACID properties, ensure data integrity, consistency, isolation, and durability in database systems.
