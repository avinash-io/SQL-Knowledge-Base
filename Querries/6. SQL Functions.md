# SQL Functions

SQL provides a wide range of built-in functions for various purposes such as string manipulation, date and time operations, numeric calculations, and more. Below, I'll provide examples for each category:

## String Manipulation Functions:

**CONCAT:** Concatenates two or more strings together.

```sql
SELECT CONCAT('Hello ', 'World') AS ConcatenatedString;
```

Output:

```
Hello World
```

**UPPER/LOWER:** Converts a string to uppercase or lowercase.

```sql
SELECT
    UPPER('hello') AS UppercaseString,
    LOWER('WORLD') AS LowercaseString;
```

Output:

```
HELLO, world
```

**LENGTH:** Returns the length of a string.

```sql
SELECT LENGTH('Hello') AS StringLength;
```

Output:

```
5
```

**SUBSTRING:** Extracts a substring from a string.

```sql
SELECT SUBSTRING('Hello World', 7) AS SubstringFrom7;
```

Output:

```
World
```

**REPLACE:** Replaces occurrences of a substring within a string.

```sql
SELECT REPLACE('Hello World', 'World', 'Universe') AS ReplacedString;
```

Output:

```
Hello Universe
```

## Date and Time Functions:

**CURRENT_DATE/CURRENT_TIME/CURRENT_TIMESTAMP:** Returns the current date, time, or timestamp.

```sql
SELECT
    CURRENT_DATE AS Today,
    CURRENT_TIME AS CurrentTime,
    CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AS CurrentTimestamp;
```

**DATE_FORMAT:** Formats a date as a string.

```sql
SELECT DATE_FORMAT('2024-03-29', '%Y-%m-%d') AS FormattedDate;
```

Output:

```
2024-03-29
```

**DATE_ADD/DATE_SUB:** Adds or subtracts a specified time interval from a date.

```sql
SELECT
    DATE_ADD('2024-03-29', INTERVAL 1 DAY) AS Tomorrow,
    DATE_SUB('2024-03-29', INTERVAL 1 MONTH) AS LastMonth;
```

**DATEDIFF:** Calculates the difference between two dates.

```sql
SELECT DATEDIFF('2024-04-01', '2024-03-29') AS DaysDifference;
```

Output:

```
2
```

## Numeric Functions:

**ABS:** Returns the absolute value of a number.

```sql
SELECT ABS(-10) AS AbsoluteValue;
```

Output:

```
10
```

**ROUND:** Rounds a number to a specified number of decimal places.

```sql
SELECT ROUND(3.14159, 2) AS RoundedNumber;
```

Output:

```
3.14
```

**CEIL/FLOOR:** Rounds a number up or down to the nearest integer.

```sql
SELECT
    CEIL(4.3) AS CeilNumber,
    FLOOR(4.7) AS FloorNumber;
```

Output:

```
5, 4
```

**POWER/SQRT:** Calculates the power or square root of a number.

```sql
SELECT
    POWER(2, 3) AS PowerResult,
    SQRT(16) AS SquareRootResult;
```

Output:

```
8, 4
```

These are just a few examples of the many functions available in SQL. Experiment with them in your database environment to become more familiar with their usage and capabilities.
